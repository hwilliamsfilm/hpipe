# hPipe

hPipe is a collection of tools focused around a small portable USD VFX pipeline. Currently, hPipe has hook-ins for Nuke and Houdini with more coming soon. 

The package depends on two databases: a **project database** that manages active projects, and an **asset database** that can store different asset types: Image Sequences, USD components, ProjectFiles, and Reviewables.
