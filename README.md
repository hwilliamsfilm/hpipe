# hPipe

hPipe is a collection of tools focused around a small and portable USD VFX pipeline. Currently, hPipe has hook-ins for Nuke and Houdini with more coming soon. 

The package relies on two databases: a **project database** that manages active projects, and an **asset database** that can store different asset types: Image Sequences, USD components, ProjectFiles, and Reviewables.

# Package Features:

- Output and Asset Browser that cuts out needless effort finding reviewables
- Conversion tools built-in that focus on convenience
- Project database that can store useful information about projects and shots
- Asset database that can be used to store all kinds of assets for use in different DCCs
- A basic USD core for building larger more complicated scenes
- Everything simplified for ease of updating 
- Free and open source
