Repository Notes:

PURPOSE:

Unify DCCs to one core database and file management system for VFX projects. Small package of utility GUI apps to help artists.

This will currently support and have features for:
    > Houdini (Py3+) (Solaris, Arnold, Karma)
    > Nuke (Py3+)
    > Deadline
    > RV
    > USD
Future implementations:
    > Maya
    > Blender

Creates and maintains a database of projects, shots, assets in a json file. Additionally, it has a file management system
that can be used to create and manage project assets. There are several convenient scripts and software implementations
for Houdini and Nuke that can be used to make the pipeline more useful.

Configuration file for the database and related properties is in core.constants.

Apps:
    > pipeManager -> GUI for managing projects, shots, assets, and file management
    > pipeConfig -> GUI for configuring the database and related properties
    > pipeViewer[*in progress*] -> GUI for viewing outputs

Core:
    > Data manager class entry point to DB
                e.g. DataManager().get_projects() -> list of projects

    > Project/ Shot objects are generated from data manager but can be manually instantiated.
                e.g. Project('project_name').get_shots() -> list of shots

Assets:
    > Filepath / Directory classes take str arguments and do some verifications. Has functions
    that are useful in other areas of the repo
                e.g. Filepath(<string filepath>).system_path() -> returns the system path for the operating system that
                is running the script

    > ImageSequence class built for EXR, PNG, JPG but will be expanded. Has functions aimed at
    usefulness in various software. Also can be used to convert between image formats
                e.g. ImageSequence(<string filepath>).get_frame_range() -> returns the frame range of the sequence
                e.g. ImageSequence(<string filepath>).to_mp4() -> converts the sequence to an mp4

Future plans:
    + add pyside GUI for browsing outputs

    + add support for more file management tasks like removing caches, creating deliveries, auto-ingest of
    assets and plates, etc.
